     This algorithm uses two pointers: a slow pointer and a fast pointer. The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time. If there is a loop in the linked list, the two pointers will eventually meet at some point. If there is no loop, the fast pointer will reach the end of the list.*/
