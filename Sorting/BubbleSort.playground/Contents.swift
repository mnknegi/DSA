/*
 Bubble Sort: Repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
 */

// Input : [14, 33, 27, 35, 10]
/*
  ------------------------- First Iteration -------------------------
 - Compare first second elements(14, 33) and check which is greater. In case if it is already sorted then compare next two.
 [14, 33, 27, 35, 10]

 - Compare second and third elements(33, 27). Third element is smaller than second so the two values must be swapped.
 [14, 27, 33, 35, 10]

 - Compare third and fourth elements(33, 35). If third element is smaller then do nothing, otherwise swap the two elements.
 [14, 27, 33, 35, 10]

 - Compare fourth and fifth elements.
 [14, 27, 33, 10, 35]
 ------------------------- First Iteration Complete -------------------------

 ------------------------- Second Iteration -------------------------
 - Compare first second elements(14, 27) and check which is greater. if first element is greater, then swap elements.
 [14, 27, 33, 10, 35]

 - Compare second and third elements(27, 33).
 [14, 27, 33, 10, 35]

 - Compare third and fourth elements(33, 10). Swap them
 [14, 27, 10, 33, 35]

 - No need to compare fourth and fifth elements as fifth element is already sorted.

 ------------------------- Second Iteration Complete -------------------------

 ------------------------- Third Iteration -------------------------
 - Compare first second elements(14, 27) and check which is greater. if first element is greater, then swap elements.
 [14, 27, 10, 33, 35]

 - Compare second and third elements(27, 10).
 [14, 10, 27, 33, 35]

 - No need to compare third and fourth elements as fourth element is already sorted.

 ------------------------- Third Iteration Complete -------------------------

 ------------------------- Fourth Iteration -------------------------
 - Compare first and second element(14, 10).
 [10, 14, 27, 33, 35]

 - No need to compare third and fourth elements as fourth element is already sorted.

/*
 Pseudocode:

 - We loop through the array multiple times.
 - Each pass "bubbles" the largest unsorted element to the end.
 - Outer loop run from 0..< size (or 0..<size - 1(optimized) both acceptable).
 - We optimized by reducing the range(n - i - 1) each time.
 - Break early if no swap happens(the array is already sorted).
